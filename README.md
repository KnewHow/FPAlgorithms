We will try solve all problems in CLRS with functional way. If you has interesting, you can join us to complete this project. In this project, we will use `Scala` as the main language. For each algorithms, we try to write it with scala code then test it with test cases. What's more, we often to write some test case to compare two algorithms running time. In order to generate test cases easily, we use [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) and [ScalaProp](https://github.com/KnewHow/ScalaProp) as testing tool, you can read more by above links.
