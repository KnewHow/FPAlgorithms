* A

We knew that 2(f(n) + g(n)) =< 2max(f(n), g(n)) => .5(f(n) + g(n)) =< max(f(n) + g(n))

We also knew max(f(n) + g(n)) <= max(f(n) + g(n)) + min(f(n) + g(n)) = f(n) + g(n)

So, the 0.5(f(n) + g(n)) =< max(f(n) + g(n)) <= f(n) + g(n)

c1 is 0.5 and c2 is 1.

## 3.1-3

*  Q
Explain why the statement, “The running time of algorithm A is at least O(n^2)” is meaningless.
*  A
O-notation is defining a upper bound, but `at least` is defining a lower bound, you can say `at least n^2`, but don't say `at least O(n^2)`

## 3.1-4

*  Q
Is 2^(n+1) = O(2^n)? Is 2^(2n) = O(2^n)

*  A

2^(n+1) = 2 * 2^2 => O(2^n) is right. Howover 2^(2n) = 4^n >=  O(2^2), So the 2^(2n) != O(2^n)

## 3.1-5

* Q
Prove Theorem 3.1. For any two functions f(n) and g(n), we have f(n) = Θ(g(n)) if and only if f(n) = O(g(n)) and f(n) = Ω(g(n)).
* A
if f(n) = Ω(g(n)), so f(n) >= c1 * g(n)
if f(n) = O(g(n)), so 0 <= f(n) <= c2 * g(n), So
c1 * g(n) =< f(n) =< c2 * g(n), So f(n) = Θ(n)
