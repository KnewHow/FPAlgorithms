Consider the searching problem:Input: A sequence of n numbers A= (1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n i and a value
Output: An index i such that  D AŒi or the special value NIL if  does not
appear in A.
Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking
for . Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that
your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.
