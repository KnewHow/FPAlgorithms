Consider the searching problem:Input: A sequence of n numbers $$A = (a_{1}, a_2)
Output: An index i such that  D AÅ’i or the special value NIL if  does not
appear in A.
Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking
for . Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that
your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.
