## Correctness of bubblesort


## A
* a
ecch elements in original sequence can be find in result sequence.

* b
  Each loop, we will find the smallest element from `i` to `A.length`,
  when we has find the `n-1`th smallest element, the whole sequence will be sorted
  proof:
  Initialization:
  At first, we will find the smallest elements from `1` to `A.length`,
  we start from last element of the sequence, if `A[j] < A[j-1]` indicating `A[j-1]` don't smallest element in `i` to`A.length`, so we need swap position of them. If `A[j] >= A[j-1]`, indicating `A[j]` don't the smallest the element in `i` to `A.length`, exclusiving it.

  Matainance:
  After search smallest element from `1` to `A.length`, we will find the second smallest from `2` to `A.length`, then
  let `i++`and repeat this process.

  Termination:
  When we find `n-1`th smallest element, the last element is bigest, so the whole sequence is sorted.

* c
Answer has been give in b.

* d
The bubble-sort is a little like selection-sort, search nth smallest in sublist, find the smallest element
in whole sequence, it need scan `n` elements, find the second smallest element in `2` to `A.length`, it will scan `n-1` elements. So in anywhere, bubble running time is O(n^2). But insertion-sort worst running time is O(n^2), best running time is O(n).
