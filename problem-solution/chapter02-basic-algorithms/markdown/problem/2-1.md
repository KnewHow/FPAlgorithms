## Q
Insertion sort on small arrays in merge sort Although merge sort runs in `nlgn` worst-case time and insertion sort runs in `O(n^2)` worst-case time, the constant factors in insertion sort can make it faster in practice for small problem sizes on many machines. Thus, it makes sense to coarsen the leaves of the recursion by using insertion sort within merge sort when subproblems become sufficiently small. Consider a modification to merge sort in
which `n/k` sublists of length k are sorted using insertion sort and then merged using the standard merging mechanism, where k is a value to be determined.
* a. Show that insertion sort can sort the `n/k` sublists, each of length k, in `O(nk)` worst-case time.
* b. Show how to merge the sublists in O(n/lg(n/k)) worst-case time.
* c. Given that the modified algorithm runs in O(nk + nlg(n/k)) worst-case time, what is the largest value of k as a function of n for which the modified algorithm has the same running time as standard merge sort, in terms of O-notation?
* d. How should we choose k in practice?

## A
* a
insert-sort k length elements need took `O(k^2)`, but there are `n/k` sublist, so the total time is `k^2 * n/k` = O(nk)

* b
when all sublist with `k` length is sorted, we just need to merge them. Each time to merge need took O(n), but there are only `lg(n/k)` times, so the total times is `O(nlg(n/k))`

* c
We suppose `a` is the coeffients of insertion-sort and `b` is the coeffients of merge sort, so the express is:
`ank + bnlg(n/k) = bnlgn` => `ak = blgk`

* d
