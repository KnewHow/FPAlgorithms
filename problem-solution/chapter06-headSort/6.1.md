## 6.1.1

*  Q
What are the minimum and maximum numbers of elements in a heap of height h?

*  A

The maximum elements is `2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(h-2) = 2^(h-1) - 1`.
The minimun elements is `2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(h-3) + 1 = 2^(h-2)`.

## 6.1-2

*  Q
Show that an n-element heap has height [lgn].

*  A
`2^(h-2) <= n <= 2^(h-1) - 1 => h > ln(n+1) + 1 and h < ln(n) + 2`.

## 6.1-3

*  Q
Show that in any subtree of a max-heap, the root of the subtree contains the largest value occurring anywhere in that subtree.

*  A

By definecation, we can know the max-heap need statisty `A[PARENT(i)] >= A[i]`, So max-heap sub tree max element is root element.

## 6.1-4

*  Q
Where in a max-heap might the smallest element reside, assuming that all elements are distinct?

*  A
It must be leaf node.

## 6.1-5

*  Q
Is an array that is in sorted order a min-heap?

*  A
Yes, because `A[i] <= A[2i] && A[i] <= A[2i+1]`.

## 6.1-6

*  Q
Is the array with values h23; 17; 14; 6; 13; 10; 1; 5; 7; 12i a max-heap?

*  A
No!

## 6.1-7

*  A
if the node has children,its index must less than `[n/2]`, so leaf node is `[n/2]+1`,`[n/2]+2` ... `n`
