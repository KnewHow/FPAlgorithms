# 5.3

## 5.3-1

*  Q
Professor Marceau objects to the loop invariant used in the proof of Lemma 5.5. He questions whether it is true prior to the first iteration. He reasons that we could just as easily declare that an empty subarray contains no 0-permutations. Therefore, the probability that an empty subarray contains a 0-permutation should be 0, thus invalidating the loop invariant prior to the first iteration. Rewrite the procedure RANDOMIZE-IN-PLACE so that its associated loop invariant applies to a nonempty subarray prior to the first iteration, and modify the proof of Lemma 5.5 for your procedure.

*  A
   *  Initialization
      Before first loop, the i=2, the probability contain the permutation `A[1,1]` is `(n-1)!/n!`, statisfy the `(n-i+1)!/n!`
  *  Maintenance
     Suppose before `ith` loop, the probability containning the permutation `A[1, i-1]` is `(n-i+1)!/n!`, after `ith` loop, the probability containning the permutation `A[1,i]` is `Pr{E1 And E2} = Pr{E1|E2}Pr{E2} = (n-1)!/n!`
  *  Termination
     when `i=n+1`, the probability containning the permutation `A[1,n]` is `1/n!`

 So the algorithms is right.

*  A
It can be complete, because `A[0]` must swap element with `A[1]` to `A[n-1]`. So `A[0]` will always be swaped. For example, `A=[1,2,3]` don't get `A=[1,3,2]` after execute this algorithms.

## 5.3-3
*  Q
Suppose that instead of swapping element A[i] with a random element from the subarray A[i..n], we swapped it with a random element from anywhere in the array:
```
n = A.length
for i = 1 to n
  swap A[i] A[Random(1,n)]
```
Does this code do what Professor Kelp intends?

*  A
This code will product `n^n` sequences, but a normal random permutation is `n!`.

## 5.3-4

*  A

The algorithms just let each element move `offset` step in array(you can make array as a circle). So each element at `B` is `1/n`. But the all permutation is `n` not `n!`, so the algorithms is error.

## 5.3-5
*  P
Prove that in the array P in procedure PERMUTE-BY-SORTING, the probability that all elements are unique is at least `1-(1/n)`.
